# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# Milestone 1
I have built a program prints a list of 5 items in a list, prints a random word from the list using choice method from random module and asks a user to enter a single input. There is an if statement to ensure that the input is an alphabetical character and has length equal to 1.

# Milestone 2
Extened functionality to check if the guess is in the word and sorted code into two functions in order to have an idea of which lines do what.
