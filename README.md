# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# Milestone 1
I have built a program prints a list of 5 items in a list, prints a random word from the list using choice method from random module and asks a user to enter a single input. There is an if statement to ensure that the input is an alphabetical character and has length equal to 1.

# Milestone 2
Extended functionality to check if the guess is in the word and sorted code into two functions in order to have an idea of which lines do what.

# Milestone 3
Used OOP to contain the thrid milestone of the hangman game and added methods more functionality to deal with how the program handles with a letter being in the word or not.

# Milestone 4
I defined the whole game by running a while True loop inside a function that will run the ask_for_input method in the Hangman class is the letters have not all been guessed, tell the player that they have lost if they have run out of lives or tell them they have won if they managed to guess the word correctly.
