# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

# Milestone 1
I have built a program prints a list of 5 items in a list, prints a random word from the list using choice method from random module and asks a user to enter a single input. There is an if statement to ensure that the input is an alphabetical character and has length equal to 1.

# Milestone 2
Extended functionality to check if the guess is in the word and sorted code into two functions in order to have an idea of which lines do what.

# Milestone 3
Used OOP to contain the thrid milestone of the hangman game and added methods more functionality to deal with how the program handles with a letter being in the word or not. Developed two methods to deal with the core functionality of the hangman game: check_guess and ask_for_input.

# Milestone 4
I defined the whole game by running a while True loop inside a function that will run the ask_for_input method in the Hangman class is the letters have not all been guessed, tell the player that they have lost if they have run out of lives or tell them they have won if they managed to guess the word correctly.

# Summary
I made use of the fundamentals of python as well as basic object oriented programming to come up with this solution. I can improve this solution by potentially adding static methods as well as displaying all of the attributes in the class to the user.

# Bugs and fixes
Errors were made when it came to using classes such as forgetting to include the self keyword when creating classes and not making the default variable the last parameter in the method. All of the bugs were solved and thre terminal error messages were enough to help me along the way. It was easy to get stuck in an infinite loop at times, therefore debugging using print and break statements were key.
